# Solving Word Ladder with A* Search Algorithm
**Word Ladder** is a famous word game invented by [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll). This puzzle begins with two words (startword and goalword) and for solving the problem one must find a chain of other words to create a bridge between start and goal word. In every step, the adjacent words are differed by only one letter. There are a lot of variants of this problem. Most of the cases, it is assumed that the word length will be fixed and there will be a dictionary given. The ladder formed by the intermediate words must be present in the dictionary.

In this particular problem, the word lengths are not fixed. A player tries to reach from the "start word" to the "goal word". In every step, the player must either add one letter to the word from the previous step or simply remove a letter, and then rearrange the letters to make a new word. A file (**wordList.txt**) contains a list of words. All words in between must exist in the file.
